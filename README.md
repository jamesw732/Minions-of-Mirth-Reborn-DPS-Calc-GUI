# Minions-of-Mirth-Reborn-DPS-Calc

This is probably the worst written GUI program every created (my first time using tkinter).

## Some notes on use
1. This program may not work if your name has the word "for" at the end of it. This might be a simple fix.
2. If you're trying to track the dps with a name that has more than one word, only put the first word of the name in the "Name" box. Getting around this is annoying and will create more problems similar to the "for" issue.
3. If your name is the same as the monster you're fighting, your stats will just be added together, and there's no way around this.
4. This program works great for sustained encounters, but pretty much doesn't work at all if you only have a few hits, due to the way logs are updated.
5. You should be able to start/stop the dps tracking without relaunching the program, but I haven't bug tested this a whole lot yet.
